# Python Scripts
* f05_feature_selection.py script executed the feature selection scheme in parallel for each dataset

# Jupyter Notebooks
* nb05_feature_selection.ipynb follows the proposed feature selection scheme in one dataset
* nb06_interdataset_feature_selection_analysis.ipynb analizes commonalities of features between datasets
* nb07_intradataset_feature_selection_analysis.ipynb analizes the most important features within every dataset
